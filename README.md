# IBM Full Stack Professional Certificate Course Projects

This repository is to store and display all of the hands-on projects I am doing as I progress
through IBM's Full Stack Professional Course on Coursera.

It will be labeled by Course x (for a total of 15, skipping courses without hands-on to push).
Within each course will have the Modules. With the exception of Course 1 and Module 1 in Course 3,
all hands on projects will be labeled based on which module they were in and which project number they were (in order).
