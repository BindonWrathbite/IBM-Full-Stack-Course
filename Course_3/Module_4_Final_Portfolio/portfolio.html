            Hi, I'm Zac Thompson! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>

          <p>
            I am a full stack developer with experience in both application and presentation layers.
            I have explored many avenues in Information Technology, including web development, data science, and cybersecurity.
            I have ultimately found my passion in web development, where I can combine my creativity with my technical skills.
            I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that help businesses grow.
            My favorite project I have worked on so far is my TTRPG Combat Simulator. Now that I have skills in HTML, CSS, and JS, 
            I am excited to see how I can improve apps that I have previously made.

          Zac has worked to develop skills quickly so that he could achieve his desired career change.
          He has proven that he has the ability to work quickly and learn material at a fast rate.

          Zachery is a very hardworking and dedicated individual. 
          He is always willing to go the extra mile to get the job done.
          He is currently a teacher and beginning his Masters classes at SNHU but
          he still manages to keep up with extra studies on Coursera, his side gigs as 
          a semi-professional D&D DM, and his family.

          Working with Zachery has been a pleasure. He is a very hardworking and dedicated individual.
          From the time he joined our school district, he immediately started working on helping improve 
          the climate and culture, the instrumental music program and the morale of his colleagues.
