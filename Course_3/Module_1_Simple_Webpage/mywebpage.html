        <h1>Zachery M. Thompson - About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello!
            <br>
            I am currently an instrumental music teacher and have always been interested in computer science, 
            specifically the development aspect of things. I am currently enrolled in the IBM Full Stack Professional Certificate
            Course and have officially started my Master of Science in Information Technology. I am excited for what opportunities
            that this may bring to me as I begin navigating a career change!
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my hobbies is playing tabletop games, especially Dungeons & Dragons. 
            I have been playing for many years and have even turned it into a side business 
            where I 3D print and run games for other players. Below is my company logo!

        I have an amazing fiancee and a few pets at home:
            <li>Caiti - Fiancee</li> <!-- I could have done as ul but did not like formatting-->
            <li>Dean - Husky</li>
            <li>Dustin - Husky</li>
            <li>Luna - Chinchilla</li>
